      <p id="start">I’ve never liked school, but I’ve always been passionate about learning.</p>
      <p>In high school and the beginning years of college, I was required to take many classes that, though foundational, 
      did not spark my interest. Instead, whenever I had a lot more free time, I tried to learn as much as I could about 
      subjects that excited me. My interests were constantly changing as I tried to figure out what I was passionate about, 
      switching from writing stories to learning Python to video-editing and more. Even when I was interning full-time my 
      sophomore summer, I would get off work and go straight to a coffee shop, where I was starting to teach myself HTML 
      and CSS. </p>
      <p>I was unemployed for my junior year summer, which caused a lot of stress and discouragement. Much of this pressure 
      was unnecessarily self-induced, especially since I had the option to intern at a company that I wasn’t really interested 
      in. Instead of accepting that offer, I decided to devote the summer to discovering what I loved doing and wanted to do in 
      the future. </p>
      <p>At the beginning of the summer, I bit the bullet and paid for Codecademy’s premium membership. I took full advantage 
      of this month, as I completed lesson after lesson of Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, and their full course on game design. 
      At the time, I thought that I wanted to go into game design, especially since games were one of the few things I knew I 
      loved. However, after participating in an Adobe Design Challenge in June and joining a couple friends in creating a 
      productivity/journalling app, I learned that I wanted to focus my skills on designing and developing to improve the 
      human experience.</p>
      <p>I am so grateful to my friend for asking me to join her team, even though I had little to no design or app development 
      skills. In order to contribute as much as I could, I threw myself into learning more about designing in Figma and coding in 
      React Native, the framework we used to develop the app, that I ended up being the primary UX designer and front-end developer. 
      I learned so much from this project... and I loved what I was doing so much that I couldn’t stop. </p>
      <p>When my final semester of school rolled around, I decided to enroll in an introductory course for web design. Though I 
      had already taught myself the material by then, I wanted a more formal training so that I could refine my skills. I gained 
      a lot more practice and confidence in my abilities from this class, despite the material being so basic. </p>
      <p>Even though my years of schooling have finally concluded, I am learning new things everyday in this field that I’ve 
      only recently discovered a passion for. I am constantly growing and striving to improve. Let’s learn more, together :-)</p>
