          <h1>Roommates</h1>
          <p>A mobile app that streamlines the shared housing experience for college students living off-campus. 
          Developed through Propel, an incubator program run by Cornell Design & Tech Initiative.</p>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Roommates began as a mere idea between two roommates who worked and lived well together. Though our own living 
        situation was unproblematic, we recognized through conversations with our peers a problem space that was unaccounted 
        for: how to organize and communicate with your roommates. We wanted to design a product that would improve the shared 
        housing experience for college students by addressing problems related to move-in, chores, expenses, and house rules.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Design process -->
      <div>
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>With 10 weeks until Demo Day, we divided our plan into two sprints: user research and prototyping.  Our design process 
        had 4 steps:</p>
        <img src="images/rm/designprocess.svg" alt="Design Process" width="100%" height="auto">

        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>We decided to spend the majority of our time on research.</p>
        <img src="images/rm/roadmap.png" alt="Roadmap" width="100%" height="auto">
      </div>

      <!-- Research -->
      <div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Our research consisted of market research and user research.  This allowed us to <span class="b">understand our users</span> as well 
        as <span class="b">understand why there were no leading current solutions</span>.</p>
        <img src="images/rm/researchmethods.png" alt="Research Methods" width="100%" height="auto">

        <h3>Market Research</h3>
        <p>We began by researching existing platforms that were similar to what we wanted to achieve. The current market has many applications 
        that tackle a single aspect of living with others; for example, only chores, or only splitting expenses.</p>
        <p>We discovered one app, RoomMate, that all-encompassed the features we had in mind, excluding how to track move-in information. We 
        downloaded the app in order to gain a deeper look at the product and noted our key insights:</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img src="images/rm/market.png" alt="RoomMate screenshot" width="auto" height="400px">
          <div>
            <div class="row">
              <h3>RoomMate</h3>
              <p>Link</p>
            </div>
            <p class="i">Manage multiple shared spaces with your friends, your family, your university classmates or whoever you prefer!</p>
            <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The target audience is primarily European users.</li>
              <li>The app has poor UI/UX (the interface is extremely cluttered, the user flow is not intuitive, the design is not appealing).</li>
              <li>It takes too long to set up tasks, especially if recurring.</li>
              <li>It takes too long to set up tasks, especially if recurring.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Why did we end up not using an app that was so similar to what we wanted to accomplish?</h3>
        <p>Although the poor UX contributed to its failure, it became evident that the living problems we personally encountered were not painful 
        enough to change the system we already had in place. After speaking with our mentors, we realized that in order for this product to be 
        successful, <span class="b">it would have to be 10x better than anything that currently exists</span>.</p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>Understanding the biggest pain points experienced when living with someone else was crucial to designing a product users would 
        actually commit to.</p>
        <p>We released a survey that took an initial read of the challenges users faced with shared housing. The primary intention of this 
        survey was to <span class="b">gauge what points were more painful than others — not quantify how painful they were</span>.</p>
        <img src="images/rm/surveyresults.png" alt="Survey results" width="100%">

        <p>A preliminary analysis of our survey results made us realize that our current target audience of Cornell students was too broad. 
        We decided to <span class="b">narrow the target audience of the MVP to only off-campus housings of 2–7 people</span>.</p>
        <p>We conducted 9 interviews with students within this user group in order to further understand what was making these living 
        situations so stressful.</p>

      <!-- Insights -->
      <div>
        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="b">College housemates/roommates struggle to manage and organize shared spaces.</span>
            <ul>
              <li>This is primarily due to different cleanliness standards/lifestyles and a lack of communication, established systems, and accountability.</li>
              <li>Situations are worse when living with strangers.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">Creating a system that everyone agrees on can be difficult.</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Systems are in regards to chores, prorating rooms, and how to handle COVID-19.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">When housemates do set initial agreements, the system often fizzles out over time or only some stick to them.</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Some chores or rules are not established in the beginning.</li>
              <li>People avoid calling others out on things to eschew tension and confrontation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">Current solutions are not centralized.</span>
            <ul>
              <li>The application should be all-encompassing so that users do not have to switch between platforms, which makes it easier for users to
              commit and be held accountable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

      </div>

      <!-- Ideate -->
      <div>
        <h2>Ideate</h2>
        <p>Based on our insights, we outlined user experience priorities:</p>
        <img src="images/rm/uxpriorities.png" alt="UX priorities" width="100%">
        <p>With the amount of time we had left before demo day, we also needed to prioritize some aspects of the design over others. 
        We decided to <span class="b">prioritize breadth over depth</span>, due to one of the problems being that existing solutions 
        are not centralized.</p>
        <p>We designed 5 key features of Roommates that addressed the insights we gained:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Onboarding</li>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>Expense</li>
          <li>Shopping</li>
          <li>Chores</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These 5 features together offer a centralized solution, as desired in Insight #4.</p>

        <p>After determining the features we wanted to include in our app, we then constructed an information architecture to map out the 
        user flow in the app:</p>
        <img src="images/rm/infoarch.jpg" alt="Information Architecture" width="100%">
      </div>

      <!-- Wireframing -->
      <div>
        <h2>Wireframing</h2>
        <p>After knowing what features we wanted to include, sketching their initial designs was a short process.</p>
        <img src="images/rm/wireframe-chores.png" alt="Chores Wireframes" width="100%">
        <img src="images/rm/wireframe-shopping.png" alt="Shopping Wireframes" width="100%">
      </div>

      <!-- Design -->
      <div>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Small adjustments were made to the initial sketches as we further fleshed out the app and made the designs more consistent.</p>

        <h3>Onboarding Survey</h3>

        <h3>Home</h3>

        <h3>Expenses</h3>

        <h3>Shopping</h3>

        <h3>Chores</h3>

        Here is the final design we presented for Demo Day:
