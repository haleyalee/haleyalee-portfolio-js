      <!-- Introduction -->
      <div class="section hideme">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Roommates began as a mere idea between two roommates who worked and lived well together. Though our own living 
        situation was unproblematic, we recognized through conversations with our peers a problem space that was unaccounted 
        for: how to organize and communicate with your roommates. We wanted to design a product that would improve the shared 
        housing experience for college students by addressing problems related to move-in, chores, expenses, and house rules.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Design process -->
      <div class="section hideme">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Design Process</h2>
        <p>With 10 weeks until Demo Day, we divided our plan into two sprints: user research and prototyping.  Our design process 
        had 4 steps:</p>

          <p>Design process.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="cs-subsection-title">Roadmap</h3>
        <p>We decided to spend the majority of our time on research.</p>
        <div class="cs-img hideme">
          <img src="images/rm/roadmap.png" alt="Roadmap" width="100%" height="auto">
          <p>Roadmap.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Research -->
      <div class="section hideme">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Research</h2>
        <p>Our research consisted of market research and user research.  This allowed us to <span class="b">understand our users</span> as well 
        as <span class="b">understand why there were no leading current solutions</span>.</p>
        <div class="cs-img class="hideme">

        </div>
        <div class="sub-section hideme">
          <h3 class="cs-subsection-title">Market Research</h3>
          <p>We began by researching existing platforms that were similar to what we wanted to achieve. The current market has many applications 
          that tackle a single aspect of living with others; for example, only chores, or only splitting expenses.</p>
          <p>We discovered one app, RoomMate, that all-encompassed the features we had in mind, excluding how to track move-in information. We 
          downloaded the app in order to gain a deeper look at the product and noted our key insights:</p>

            <div>
              <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between; padding-top: 30px;">
                <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">RoomMate</h3>
                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roommate.android&hl=en_US&gl=US">&#129149;</a>
              </div>
              <p class="i">Manage multiple shared spaces with your friends, your family, your university classmates or whoever you prefer!</p>
              <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The target audience is primarily European users.</li>
                <li>The app has poor UI/UX (the interface is extremely cluttered, the user flow is not intuitive, the design is not appealing).</li>
                <li>It takes too long to set up tasks, especially if recurring.</li>
                <li>We stopped using it after one day.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h3>Why did we end up not using an app that was so similar to what we wanted to accomplish?</h3>
          <p>Although the poor UX contributed to its failure, it became evident that the living problems we personally encountered were not painful 
          enough to change the system we already had in place. After speaking with our mentors, we realized that in order for this product to be 
          successful, <span class="b">it would have to be 10x better than anything that currently exists</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="cs-subsection-title">User Research</h3>
          <p>Understanding the biggest pain points experienced when living with someone else was crucial to designing a product users would 
          actually commit to.</p>
          <p>We released a survey that took an initial read of the challenges users faced with shared housing. The primary intention of this 
          survey was to <span class="b">gauge what points were more painful than others — not quantify how painful they were</span>.</p>

            <p>Example survey results.</p>
          </div>
  
          <p>A preliminary analysis of our survey results made us realize that our current target audience of Cornell students was too broad. 
          We decided to <span class="b">narrow the target audience of the MVP to only off-campus housings of 2–7 people</span>.</p>
          <p>We conducted 9 interviews with students within this user group in order to further understand what was making these living 
          situations so stressful.</p>

          <h3><a class="num">#1</a> College housemates/roommates struggle to manage and organize shared spaces.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>This is primarily due to different cleanliness standards/lifestyles and a lack of communication, established systems, and accountability.</li>
            <li>Situations are worse when living with strangers.</li>

        <div class="insight">

            <li>People avoid calling others out on things to eschew tension and confrontation.</li>

        <div class="insight">
          <h3><a class="num">#4</a> Current solutions are not centralized.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The application should be all-encompassing so that users do not have to switch between platforms, which makes it easier for users to
            commit and be held accountable.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <!-- Ideate -->
      <div class="section hideme">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Ideate</h2>
        <p>Based on our insights, we outlined user experience priorities:</p>
        <div class="cs-img hideme">
          <img src="images/rm/uxpriorities.png" alt="UX priorities" width="100%">
          <p>UX priorities.</p>
        </div>
        <p>With the amount of time we had left before demo day, we also needed to prioritize some aspects of the design over others. 
        We decided to <span class="b">prioritize breadth over depth</span>, due to one of the problems being that existing solutions 
        are not centralized.</p>
        <p>We designed 5 key features of Roommates that addressed the insights we gained:</p>
        
        <div id="features" class="hideme">
          <p>
            <span class="b">Onboarding</span> — An individualized, anonymous survey allows everyone to express their preferences 
            (<span class="num b">Insight #2</span>). A summary of the results are used to 
            curate a suggested house rules list (<span class="num b">Insight #1</span>).
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span class="b">Home</span> — The home page is split into a personal space and a shared space. The personal space is where
            the user can hold themselves accountable. The shared space is public to all housemates and contains the house rules as well
            as notifications, reminders, or comments intended for the whole house (<span class="num b">Insight #1, Insight #3</span>).
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span class="b">Expenses</span> — The expenses page tracks all of the shared expenses (<span class="num b">Insight #3</span>). 
            Users can only see who exactly has paid if they are the one requesting money.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span class="b">Shopping</span> — A standard, editable grocery list that allows "joining" specific items identifies which
            items are shared (ergo, which costs are split) (<span class="num b">Insight #2</span>).
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <span class="b">Chores</span> — When users first join the app, they must make a chores chart (<span class="num b">Insight #1, Insight #2</span>)
            where they add chores, assign days and frequencies, and then designate chores to different members. An anonymous pinging system
            enables users to ping the entire house if they noticed an incomplete chore overdue (<span class="num b">Insight #3</span>). Other notifications
            include indicating when you need to delay a chore or when you want to tell someone else they did a good job.
          </p>
        </div>


        <p>These 5 features together offer a centralized solution, as desired in <span class="num b">Insight #4</span>.</p>

        <p>After determining the features we wanted to include in our app, we then constructed an information architecture to map out the 
        user flow in the app:</p>
        <div class="hideme">
          <img src="images/rm/infoarch.jpg" alt="Information Architecture" width="100%">
          <p>Information architecture.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Wireframing -->
      <div class="section hideme">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Wireframe</h2>
        <p>After knowing what features we wanted to include, sketching their initial designs was a short process.</p>
        <div class="cs-img hideme">
          <img src="images/rm/wireframe-chores.png" alt="Chores Wireframes" width="100%">
          <p>Chores wireframes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-img hideme">
          <img src="images/rm/wireframe-shopping.png" alt="Shopping Wireframes" width="100%">
          <p>Shopping wireframes.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Design -->
      <div class="section hideme">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Design</h2>

        <p>We created the first prototype of Roommates on Figma, where we could work collaboratively. We decided to make the theme a 
        yellow color to promote both happiness and positivity throughout the app.</p>

        <div class="cs-img hideme">
          <img src="images/rm/design-guide.png" alt="Design guidelines" width="100%;">
          <p>Design guidelines.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Small adjustments were made to the initial sketches as we further fleshed out the app and made the designs more consistent.</p>

        <!-- <div>

          <div class="row">

      <!-- Takeaways -->
      <div class="section hideme">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Takeaways</h2>
        
        <p>Understandably, the first iteration of our design has much to be improved upon. We did not allot ourselves enough time to both 
        finish prototyping and begin user testing, and so a lot of our design was rushed. From this, however, I learned the <span class="b">
        importance of user testing</span>, because there are many flaws that need to be fixed within our design, even though we had walked 
        through it and fleshed it out in the ideation phase.</p>

        <p>We created a <span class="b">solid foundation</span> for future development — although the design is not perfect, my understanding 
        of the problem space allowed me to create features I am proud of. I know that with more time, user research, and user testing, Roommates 
        can truly make everyone’s home feel like home.</p>

        <p>Gratefully, due to popular response from Demo Day, Roommates will be integrated as a Cornell Design & Tech Initiative project in 2021. 
        <span class="num b">I will be working as both a product manager and a UX designer to conduct more research and refine the design</span> :-)</p>
