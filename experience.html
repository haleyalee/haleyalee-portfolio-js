            <h2>Digital Signal Processing Intern</h2>
            <h4><a class="u" href="https://www.caci.com/">CACI Bit Systems</a> â€¢ Summer 2019</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="work-details"> 
            <p>
              During the summer of 2019, I interned at CACI Bit Systems in Sterling, Virginia. I was one of three interns 
              on the Navy Digital Signal Processing (DSP) team.
            </p>
            <p>
              CACI Bit Systems utilizes several digitizing receivers that enable the use of DSP algorithms to conduct various 
              missions. Their most common receivers are incredibly capable but also very expensive. There is a growing market of 
              highly capable cost-effective radio-frequency (RF) digitizer chips that can enable the implementation of software 
              defined radios (SDR) on consumer-grade computer hardware. One such SDR is the <span class="hl">Lime-SDR</span>; 
              a popular, community-backed SDR with a great deal of existing open-source support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of the summer, my task was to develop the source code in <span class="hl">C++</span> and 
              <span class="hl">Python</span> to transmit and receive streaming data to and from the Lime-SDR. I integrated 
              the Lime-SDR with the SoapySDR API and utilized the Lime-SDR within the <span class="h1">X-Midas framework</span>, 
              using the already existing receiver as a model. Additionally, I designed an interactive GUI in <span class="hl">Qt 
              Designer</span> that allows the user to tune the parameters of the device in real-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, by the end of my internship, I was able to provide demonstration DSP code that leverages a Lime-SDR and 
              completely demodulates a digital signal down to bits. This enabled us to compare the relative performance of the 
              Lime-SDR's hardware with that of comparable receivers. My work showed that the Lime-SDR is an extremely capable receiver 
              at an attractive cost point. This opens up the potential for new product lines at CACI, such as a "lite" version of 
              their existing products. It also creates the possibility of desktop receivers for developers, which reduces the overhead 
              caused by time-sharing of the limited and more expensive receiver.

            <h2>Visual Design Associate</h2>
            <h4><a class="u" href="https://www.forever21.com/us/aboutus/aboutus.html">Forever 21</a> â€¢ Summer 2018</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="work-details"> 
            <p>
              I first developed a love for design while working part-time at Forever 21 the summer of 2018. Fashion had always been an
              interest of mine, and so I took the opportunity to immerse myself within it this summer. As a visual design associate, I was 
              responsible for curating the product displays: every table, rack, and wall was carefully constructed to display the clothing in 
              the most visually captivating way. Funnily enough, from this job, I learned the importance of <span class="hl">user-centered design</span>. 
              Rather than creating outfits that suited my personal style, I had to consider what the current fashion trends were, as well 
              as what products were the most popular.
            </p>
            <p>
              I became incredibly disciplined this summer, as my workdays were from 6am to 2pm. Because the store opened mid-shift, I would also have
              to take on the role of sales associate. Through this, I was able to develop my customer service skills, which include patience, good
              communication, and efficiency.
